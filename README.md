#Huddles and problems -
I had a major issue where I couldnt map out my api correctly, with help from steven we figured out that because everything I was trying to map out was a obj we had to dot into the obj from the json. another issue I was having was getting my CSS to work. alot of research later I was able to figure it out. css-tricks.com and mozilla helped me the most with the CSS.
